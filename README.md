# Student Management System

## Overview

The **Student Management System** is a C++ project that allows users to manage student records. It supports core operations such as inserting, searching, updating, deleting, and displaying student records. The project is built with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and includes exception handling to ensure smooth and error-free functionality.

## Features

- **Insert Records**: Add new student records with essential details.
- **Search Records**: Look up student details based on unique identifiers.
- **Update Records**: Modify existing student records easily.
- **Delete Records**: Remove student records from the system.
- **Show Records**: Display all student records stored in the system.
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling implemented to ensure robust functionality, preventing crashes or invalid operations.

## Project Structure

- **Language**: C++
- **IDE**: Dev-C++  
- **Paradigm**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Prerequisites

- Dev-C++ IDE (or any compatible C++ compiler)
- Basic understanding of C++ and Object-Oriented Programming

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Student-Management-System.git
2. Open the project in Dev-C++ or your preferred C++ IDE.
3. Build and run the project.

## Usage

Once the program is running, you will be able to:
1. Insert Record: Add a student by entering their details.
2. Search Record: Input a student ID to retrieve their record.
3. Update Record: Modify an existing record.
4. Delete Record: Remove a studentâ€™s record.
5. Show All Records: Display the list of all students.

The program ensures error handling by preventing invalid inputs and operations such as accessing non-existent records or providing invalid data types.

## Exception Handling

The project utilizes exception handling mechanisms to manage runtime errors gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience. This prevents crashes when performing operations such as searching for non-existing students or attempting to delete records that don't exist.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding data persistence using file handling.
- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
